# Mobile Development Setup with Expo Go

## Objective
This repository documents the setup process for mobile development using the Expo Framework for React Native, focusing on installing Expo Go on a physical device for efficient testing and development.

## Prerequisites
- ‚úÖ **Node.js LTS** (v18.x or higher)
- ‚úÖ **VS Code IDE**
- ‚úÖ **Compatible operating system** (macOS, Linux, or Windows)
- ‚úÖ **Physical mobile device** (Android or iOS)

## Expo Go Installation Process

### Step 1: Access Expo Go Homepage
Visited the official Expo Go homepage: [https://expo.dev/go](https://expo.dev/go)

### Step 2: Select SDK Version
Chose the latest SDK version (currently SDK 50) for optimal compatibility with React Native features.

### Step 3: Device Installation

#### For Android:
1. Clicked "Install" button redirecting to Google Play Store.
2. Installed "Expo Go" app (Size: ~45MB).
3. App successfully installed on physical Android device.

#### For iOS:
1. Clicked "Install" button redirecting to Apple App Store.
2. Installed "Expo Go" app (Size: ~50MB).
3. App successfully installed on physical iOS device.

### Step 4: Initial Setup
1. Opened Expo Go app on device.
2. Created new Expo account using email authentication.
3. Completed profile setup.
4. Successfully logged into the application.

## Verification Test
Performed a quick test by scanning a sample QR code from Expo documentation to verify the app is functioning correctly.

## Challenges Faced

### During Installation:
1. **Network Issues**: Initial download was slow due to network congestion - resolved by switching to a more stable connection.
2. **Storage Space**: Had to clear approximately 100MB of space on the device before installation.
3. **Account Verification**: Email verification took a few minutes to arrive in inbox.

### Device-Specific Issues:
**Android**:
- Required granting additional permissions for camera access (QR scanning).
- Needed to enable "Install from unknown sources" temporarily.

**iOS**:
- Required iOS 13 or higher (device was compatible).
- Needed to grant camera permissions through iOS settings.

## Troubleshooting Solutions

1. **If app crashes on launch:**
   - Clear app cache/data.
   - Reinstall the application.
   - Ensure device meets minimum OS requirements.

2. **If QR code scanning doesn't work:**
   - Check camera permissions.
   - Ensure good lighting conditions.
   - Clean camera lens.

3. **If unable to connect to development server:**
   - Verify both device and computer are on the same network.
   - Check firewall settings.
   - Restart Expo development server.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Set up a new React Native project with Expo.
- [ ] Test hot-reload functionality.
- [ ] Experiment with basic components on physical device.
- [ ] Explore Expo SDK features and APIs.

# First Mobile Application Setup with Expo Router

## Objective
Set up and scaffold a new Expo project using the Expo Router template, understand the file structure, and document the process.

## Scaffolding Process


### Step 1: Navigate to Project Directory
bash
cd prodev-mobile-setup

---
## Reset Project Command

### Command Executed:
bash
npm run reset-project

## Execution Process and Effects:

1. ### Script Activation
- The custom Node.js script ./scripts/reset-project.js is executed
- User is prompted for file handling preference:

2. ### File Preservation Decision
***Do you want to move existing files to /app-example instead of deleting them? (Y/n): y***
- Choice 'Y': Existing project files are preserved and moved rather than deleted

- Creates an archive of the current project structure for reference

3. ### Directory Restructuring
üìÅ /app-example directory created.
‚û°Ô∏è /app moved to /app-example/app.
‚û°Ô∏è /components moved to /app-example/components.
‚û°Ô∏è /hooks moved to /app-example/hooks.
‚û°Ô∏è /constants moved to /app-example/constants.
‚û°Ô∏è /scripts moved to /app-example/scripts.

- Creates backup: All major directories are moved to /app-example for safekeeping
- Preserves work: No files are deleted, only relocated for reference
- Maintains structure: Original folder hierarchy is maintained within the backup

4. ### Fresh Project Scaffolding
üìÅ New /app directory created.
üìÑ app/index.tsx created.
üìÑ app/_layout.tsx created.

- Clean slate: Creates a brand new /app directory with default structure
- Core files: Generates essential Expo Router files:
- ‚úÖ app/index.tsx - New main screen component

- ‚úÖ app/_layout.tsx - Root layout configuration
```
